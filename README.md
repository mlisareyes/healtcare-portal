# Healthcare Professional Portal

This app should allow all medical providers to access their patients' information using this app. Healthcare professionals should be able to signup by creating a unique username and password, create a new patient and enter patient details such as name, birthdate, gender, and any notes during the patients' visit. You may also edit each patient's information or add notes to their file. Please note that you are only able to create, view, and edit your own patients' information.
